ProjectVisualiser
=======

ProjectVisualiser is a JavaScript based webpage for visualising progress across a number of projects.

It is built on the very cool Paper.js library and is inspired by the amazing work of Fernanda Cozzi as depicted on [datavisualisation.ch](https://datavisualization.ch/showcases/how-do-you-visualize-progress/).

Check out a live demo at the project webpage [here](http://filmstarr.github.io/ProjectVisualiser/).
